			Series of experiments and studies on black and white vettorial pattern.<br>
			The tecnique used is focused on using open-source standards and technologis with the javascript language
			to create customizable optical illusion that can be used as a pattern.<br>
			The project was inspired from the
			<a href="http://buseca.github.io/patternbolt/">PatternBolt</a> open-source project.<br>
			The project is done with the
			<a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG</a> standard with the popular
			<a href="d3js.org/">d3.js</a> library.

			Experimental psychology refers to work done by those who apply experimental methods
			to the study of behavior and the processes that underlie it.
			Experimental psychologists employ human participants and animal subjects
			to study a great many topics, including (among others) sensation and perception,
			memory, cognition, learning, motivation, emotion; developmental processes,
			social psychology, and the neural substrates of all of these.
			<br><br>
			Gestalt psychology tries to understand the laws of our ability
			to acquire and maintain meaningful perceptions in an apparently chaotic world.
			The central principle of gestalt psychology is that the mind forms a global whole
			with self-organizing tendencies.
			The original famous phrase of Gestalt psychologist Kurt Koffka,
			"The whole is other than the sum of the parts".

			Cognitive neuroscience is an academic field concerned with the scientific study
			of biological substrates underlying cognition, with a specific focus
			on the neural substrates of mental processes.
			It addresses the questions of how psychological/cognitive functions are produced
			by neural circuits in the brain. Cognitive neuroscience is a branch
			of both psychology and neuroscience, overlapping with disciplines such as physiological psychology,
			cognitive psychology, and neuropsychology.
			Cognitive neuroscience relies upon theories in cognitive science coupled with evidence
			from neuropsychology, and computational modeling.

			Parallel straight appear to be sloped.<br>
			The illusion was ascribed largely to irradiation, the light spread from dark to bright zones
			in the retinal image, and indeed the image disappears when black and white are replaced
			by different colours of the same brightness (isoluminant).<br>
			But a component of the illusion remains even when all optical and retinal components are factored out.<br>
			Contrast polarities seem to be the determining factor in the tilt's direction.<br>

			Multistable perceptual phenomena are a form of perceptual phenomena
			in which there are unpredictable sequences of spontaneous subjective changes.<br>
			Perceptual multistability can be evoked by visual patterns that are too ambiguous
			for the human visual system to recognise with one unique interpretation.

			In 1965, between February 23 and April 25 an exhibition called The Responsive Eye,
			created by William C. Seitz was held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.<br>
			The exhibition focused on the perceptual aspects of art,
			which result both from the illusion of movement and the interaction of color relationships.
